# Dog vs. Cat Classification using CNN

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying images of dogs and cats. The model is implemented using PyTorch and utilizes a simple CNN architecture to classify images into two categories: dogs and cats. The project includes training and evaluation scripts, data preprocessing, model checkpointing, and logging using TensorBoard.

## üß† Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a CNN model that can accurately classify images of dogs and cats. The model uses data preprocessing, a simple CNN architecture, and training with the SGD optimizer. It also tracks training and validation metrics such as loss and accuracy and visualizes confusion matrices.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch
- TensorFlow (for TensorBoard support)
- Matplotlib (for visualizing confusion matrix)
- scikit-learn (for evaluating the model)
- tqdm (for displaying progress bars)
- OpenCV (for image manipulation)
- pip install -r requirements.txt to install dependencies

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WhySoEazy/MyProject.git
cd MyProject
```

### 2. Install required dependencies

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Prepare the Dataset

You need to prepare the dataset for training the model. The dataset should be in the following format:

```
/root/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test/
```

The `train` and `test` directories should contain images of dogs and cats. Make sure to label them appropriately (e.g., `dog` and `cat` folders for each category).

### 4. Train the Model

Run the following command to start training the CNN model:

```bash
python train_cnn.py --root ./small_dog_cat_dataset --epochs 100 --batchs 8 --logging tensorboard --trained_model trained_model
```

This will:
- Train the model on the dataset specified by the `--root` argument.
- Log training progress to TensorBoard.
- Save the best model checkpoint to the `--trained_model` directory.

### 5. Run TensorBoard to monitor training progress

To visualize training progress, you can use TensorBoard:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=tensorboard/
```

Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:6006` to see the training metrics (loss, accuracy, etc.).

This will output the accuracy of the trained model on the test dataset.

### 8. Perform Inference on a New Image

To use the trained model for inference (classifying a new image), you can run the `test_cnn.py` script:

```bash
python test_cnn.py --image_path path_to_your_image --checkpoint trained_model/best_cnn.pt
```

This will load the model from the checkpoint, preprocess the input image, and print the predicted class (dog or cat) along with the predicted probability.

## üß© Features

- **Model Architecture**: Simple CNN built using PyTorch's `nn.Module` class.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Resizing and normalizing images to prepare them for training.
- **Training & Evaluation**: The model is trained using the SGD optimizer and evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix.
- **Checkpointing**: The best model is saved as `best_cnn.pt` during training to retain the best accuracy.
- **TensorBoard Logging**: Track loss and accuracy metrics during training, as well as visualize the confusion matrix.
- **Support for Resume Training**: Use checkpoints to resume training from a saved model.
- **Inference Script**: Perform inference on new images by specifying the image path and the trained model checkpoint.

## üí° Notes

- **GPU**: This project supports training on GPU if available (using CUDA).
- **Model Checkpoints**: If training is interrupted, you can resume from the last checkpoint using the `--checkpoint` argument.
- **Inference**: The `test_cnn.py` script uses OpenCV for loading and processing images before feeding them into the trained model.
